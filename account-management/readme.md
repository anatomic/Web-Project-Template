# Account Management

This is where any documents we produce go that support the project. This can include proposals, internal briefs, spreadsheets, etc.

You may want to store Client documents in here too, however, it is probably best to keep them with any other project assets as they are for reference when working, not a deliverable for the client.

Things to keep a note of in Account Management include:

* Project Plans (OmniPlan/Viso Gantt charts)
* Proposals
* Costs breakdowns
