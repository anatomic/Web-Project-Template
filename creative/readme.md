# Creative

Anything that we create goes in here.  Items should be separated by their application. For example:

* Photoshop files in a `psd/` folder
* Illustrator files in an `ai/` folder

Flash assets are a little bit different and require a deeper folder structure, potentially something like:

* `flash/``
  * `fla/` - Flash CS 5.x Pro files
  * `lib/` - Any 3rd Party code or SWCs
  * `src/` - Our code (in appropriate packages)
  * `swf/` - Compiled output
  * `img/` - Image assets used in the `.fla` files
